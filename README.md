# H2Project
This is a small test project that runs Spring Boot with embedded H2 database.

I created this to answer the following Stack Overflow question -
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60762845/h2-console-spring-boot-not-opening?noredirect=1#comment107517554_60762845

I wanted to see if we can access the H2 DB console URL after starting the project.
